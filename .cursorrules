Project Structure and Organization

Use a modular project structure: Separate your application into logical components such as routers, core utilities (context management, security, error handling), and models/schemas. This makes the codebase scalable and easier to maintain.

Organize routes by feature using APIRouter for clarity and modularity.

Type Safety and Validation

Use Python type hints for all function parameters and return values to enable FastAPI’s automatic documentation and validation.

Leverage Pydantic models for request and response validation, ensuring that both human and AI clients receive consistent, machine-readable data structures

Dependency Injection and Shared Logic

Use FastAPI’s dependency injection system to handle shared resources such as database connections, authentication, and rate limiting. This promotes code reuse and makes testing easier.

Chain dependencies where appropriate and decouple them for better testability and maintainability

Semantic Error Handling

Return structured, machine-readable error responses with error codes and actionable suggestions. This helps AI agents understand and recover from errors programmatically.

Use custom exception handlers to standardize error responses across your API.

Selective Endpoint Exposure

Only expose endpoints that are safe and necessary for AI integration. Avoid exposing sensitive or potentially destructive operations (e.g., DELETE, PUT) unless absolutely required.

Use tags or explicit inclusion/exclusion lists to control which endpoints are accessible to AI clients
